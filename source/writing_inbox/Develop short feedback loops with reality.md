This is the best way to LEARN

Short:
- Be prolific, take a lot of shots on goal
- Get feedback quickly (trusted testers, audience size)

Feedback:
- Encourage honesty (anonymize)
- Accept feedback non-judgmentally and from a place of truly wanting to improve

Loop:
- Run experiments _repeatedly_
- Reflect on and incorporate feedback from the previous iteration

Reality:
- Avoid overly abstracting, keep it concrete
