The traditional public school system is designed to educate all kinds of children, at scale. This tends to sacrifice efficiency and personalization. Public school is not optimized for maximizing individual learning – neither efficiency nor quantity.

Academics can be reasonably “completed” (at minimum least at the state mandated level) in a couple hours of formal instruction a day. Having the rest of the day free to be bored/work on self-directed projects/play outside is extremely valuable.

Excelling at something in life is valuable for what it teaches you & the belief/confidence it gives you. Academics are a priori relatively low-hanging fruit as Rami has good genes & peer groups. At least give him the chance to love school/learning and see if he wants to excel at it - I don’t think traditional schooling can provide that. Obviously if he doesn’t like it we can do smth else.

School implicitly teaches kids that their time is not valuable by not allowing them to progress at their own pace.

Kids have an innate ability to focus deeply which school chips away at over time. I want to nurture that state.

open qs:
- I don’t like the ‘competitive’ culture that can exist at academically focused schools. How does Alpha/GT/whatever address that? How would I address that w homeschooling? Esp because friendly competition is obviously healthy and valuable [[comment](https://substack.com/profile/87654794-matt-bateman/note/c-129983026)]
- Intelligence is [probably] not going to be the bottleneck. Being OK with being embarrassed asking for crazy things, etc. In other words, emotional fluency. That’s harder to measure/teach. How do we address that. This may be even more important tbh.
- How do I feel about the ‘incentives’ piece of Alpha? It does seem to go against a lot of the self-determination literature. This is a big one. The crowding out effect is only relevant for things the kid _already_ likes to do tho, so hm. I’m also not sure if any studies tested personalized incentives? I think they were all generic cash or equivalent.

- Would I actually spend this much money on a school? [[comment](https://substack.com/profile/87654794-matt-bateman/note/c-129954880)]
