Metacognition is the ability to step outside of your thinking process to observe, reflect, question, and improve it.

You can be good at metacognition in one domain (eg academic learning) but not in another (eg relationships).

It's harder to perform metacognition as the difficult of the task increases. This is why it is important to reflect separately.
