In other words, [[Focus on what you want to see more of]] and describe it in detail a la [[Planning is priceless, plans are worthless]]


I wake up early, take a short walk outside, make some espresso, and drink it while journaling, enjoying some peaceful solitude. I work on a creative project by myself for ~2 hours.

My wife and son have probably woken up by then, so I say I love you to them both and do silly faces and accents with my son as I feed and change him. We eat some breakfast and head outside for a walk in a park with our friend(s) who live close by.

We catch up and chat through the latest on the ambitious project we're working on together, loosely brainstorming ideas and having fun doing it. We head to a cafe to continue working and grab some lunch once we're done. A bit after lunch we head to the court to play some tennis.

Head home to continue working with friends, taking short breaks to mess around with my son and feed/change him. We either have some friends over for dinner or walk to a restaurant nearby, and have a nice evening stroll afterwards, ideally catching the sunset.

We wind down, giving my son a bath, playing with him some more, and chatting with my wife about how the day went. Read for 20-30 minutes and call it a night.

One night a week might be a board game night with friends, attending a class a friend is teaching, going out to karaoke.
