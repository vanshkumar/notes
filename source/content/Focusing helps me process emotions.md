Evidence:
- Did it multiple times to process the news that we were having a kid at the same time that I left Alphabet, which moved forward our plans to move back to LA as well
	- Articulated fear of lack of identity, of not doing something worthwhile, of wasted potential
	- Articulated fear of stagnation, issues with weed in LA
	- Articulated social isolation, and building community in Pasadena to make it feel better
	- Articulated fear of "abandoning" family by moving back to the west coast
- Did it on the plane from Nova when moving back to LA to process what I felt/needed around using my time, found I wanted to be saved/someone to tell me what to do

I wonder if you could use Focusing to [[Focus on what you want to see more of]]. To date, I've used it as a way to process emotions I would categorize as more negative. Could I use Focusing to follow my curiosity? Ask yourself "What do I love about my life right now? What am I grateful for?"

Quick description of the technique:
- Relax fully
- Ask yourself "How is my life going right now? How do I feel?"
- Non-judgmentally observe what comes up, select one problem & set the rest to the side
- Feel the body-feeling associated with what you've selected
- Wait until a handle word comes up (eg "churning panic") to describe the body-feeling
- Resonate with the body-feeling to confirm it's the best handle
- Ask it "What does it need? How can it feel better?". I literally visualize myself going up to the feeling inside my body and asking this.
- Wait until it responds, you will usually feel something 'move' in the body
