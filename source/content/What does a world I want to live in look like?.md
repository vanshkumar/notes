In other words, [[Focus on what you want to see more of]] and describe it in detail a la [[Planning is priceless, plans are worthless]].

What do I want to see more of?
- Having more regular community; friends to lean on and drink coffee with and have fun with and build cool things with and go on long walks with and [[Celebrate being bad at things and ask dumb questions]] and to play with each other's kids
- Knowing and being friends with neighbors
- Walking group (a la Board Walks)
- Having a book club / study group
- The ability to walk/bike/train to ~wherever you want to get to in your city
- Affordable housing. Very low homelessness.
- Beautiful parks with lots of trees and seating. Thought has gone into the landscaping and layout of these parks.
- More local economic opportunities. I help you out in some way that is best done locally and get paid. Examples?
	- Real estate
	- Childcare
	- Hosting an event
	- Organizing something locally political
	- Fractal U style classes
	- Teaching children (microschool)
- A "celebration of racket sports" complex to spend a lot of time at. Paddle tennis being played.
- Ultimately, people being more fulfilled and flourishing
