- Montessori-style scaffolding is applicable EVERYWHERE in life where you're trying to get into a flow state / achieve mastery. Repeated challenges just beyond your reach are the most motivating as they result in continual momentum of success/progress

	- This plays into the idea of coercion vs non-coercion as well. Coercion isn’t as useful of a frame given how important the environment is to what you choose to do, the affordances it has etc.
		- [[Where is the line between coercion and environment design?]]
- Video games are spectacularly good at providing this kind of scaffolding, and part of why it's so easy to get into a flow state when playing them (esp RPGs etc). Sports also can do this for people naturally.
- A teacher is a landscaper and a gardener. An architect who builds that ugly but necessary scaffolding you see on all the buildings in NYC.
- Math academy is literally built around this idea
- Could you have two people who know each other very well design a "curriculum" / scaffolded set of challenges for each other to learn about whatever they're interested in? I guess the other person needs to be pretty expert in whatever the thing is, so they can properly outline the concepts and create the pedagogy. Perhaps AI could help fill that gap, or just design the curriculum for you? Probably not at current power levels, hence why Math Academy exists
- This is kind of like programming your attention a la Spaced Repetition in some ways

Ask yourself [[What does a world I want to live in look like?]] and use the answers to design the scaffolding of your life.

[[Planning is priceless, plans are worthless]] – doing this for your subconscious in some sense
