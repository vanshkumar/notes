- A draining 9-5 style job where when I am done all I want to do afterwards is watch TV/play games/vegetate in some fashion
	- Why? The implication is that the job is draining because it is (1) not something I am excited to work on with (2) people I like working with. The fixed hours would exacerbate that aspect.
- An extremely busy startup-style work life where there is no slack/feeling of abundance in my life

Some kind of "independent researcher" type role would be awesome.
