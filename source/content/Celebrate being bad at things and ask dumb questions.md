I think one way to increase agency in the world is to nurture a culture that celebrates being terrible at stuff, asking dumb questions, etc, extending the grace we offer young people to everyone as much as we can (https://x.com/kaseyklimes/status/1886413505110151670)

I would love a party where everyone has to fail at something they eventually want to be good at, in front of other people. Need to be an extraordinarily safe space for this to work. I would choose singing!

When people are non-sober they "lose their inhibitions" and one way in which this manifests is being OK with being bad at things in front of others (karaoke). I want to cultivate this mindset even in normal life when sober.
